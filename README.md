# LoginNET

Login using C#, Winforms, MVC

This is an end-of-year practical assignment (2024, System Analyst, 2nd Year)



## Try it

Do you want to try this software?

Download the release (it's an .exe and the Microsoft Access database).

Default credentials are:

User: `admin@admin.com`
Password: `admin`

You can register, but you will be a standard user and will not be able to create or modify other users. Only “Administrator” or “Moderator” levels can do this. That's why I share the credentials.


All screens are in Spanish but the code is mainly in English.



## Architecture

MVC: Model View Controller

Model: CapaModel // database connection, sql querys

Controller: CapaLogica // business logic, validations

View: CapaVista // forms

Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
